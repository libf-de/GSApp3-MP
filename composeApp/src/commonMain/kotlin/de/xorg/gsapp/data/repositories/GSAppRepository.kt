/**
 * The App Repository is set up as an interface to be able to test the app easily, if I ever
 * find the time and motivation to write tests.
 * Maybe will revert to just the implementation if modifying both interface and implementation
 * continues to annoy me when writing new features.
 * ----
 * The repository shall contain functions toâ€¦
 * - load data synchronously from local, as Flow<> -> get_____()
 * - update the local data asynchronously from remote -> update_____()
 * - add new data, entered by the user -> add______()
 * - update existing data, edited by the user -> edit_____()
 * - delete local data -> delete______()
